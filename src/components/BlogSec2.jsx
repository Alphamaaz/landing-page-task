          PPC and organic marketing have proven effective in different
          scenarios, and real-world examples highlight their unique strengths. A
          startup launching a new app might rely on PPC to quickly generate buzz
          and downloads. Meanwhile, a local bakery may benefit from organic
          marketing strategies like recipe blog posts and community engagement
          on Instagram to build long-term loyalty.

        <p className="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-[18px] font-[400] mt-3 sm:mt-4">
          E-commerce brands often adopt hybrid approaches. One global clothing
          retailer uses PPC for seasonal promotions and product launches, while
          investing in SEO-rich blog content and user-generated content to drive
          consistent traffic throughout the year.
